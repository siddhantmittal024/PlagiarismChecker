The goal of Natural Language Processing is to accommodate one or more specialities of an algorithm  or  system. The  metric of  NLP assess  on an  algorithmic system  allows  for  the integration  of  language  understanding and language  generation.  It  is  even  used  in multilingual event detection Rospocher et al. purposed a novel modular system for cross-lingual event extraction for English, Dutch and Italian texts by using different pipelines for different languages. The system incorporates a modular set of foremost multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools. The pipeline integrates modules for basic NLP processing as well  as more  advanced tasks  such as cross-lingual  named entity  linking, semantic  role labelling  and  time  normalization.  Thus,  the  cross-lingual  framework  allows  for  the interpretation of  events, participants,  locations and time,  as well  as  the relations  between them. Output of these individual pipelines is intended to be used as input for a system that obtains event centric knowledge graphs.
