It takes  the information  of  which words are used in a document irrespective of number of words and order. In second model, a document is  generated by  choosing  a set  of word  occurrences and  arranging them  in any order. this  model is  called  multi-nomial model,  in addition  to  the Multi-variate  Bernoulli model, it also captures information on how many times a word is used in a document. It  is  even  used  in multilingual event detection Rospocher et al. purposed a novel modular system for cross-lingual event extraction for English, Dutch and Italian texts by using different pipelines for different languages. The system incorporates a modular set of foremost multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools.This  is  called  Multi-variate  Bernoulli model.

Discovery  of  knowledge  is becoming  important  areas  of  research over  the  recent  years. Knowledge  discovery  research  use  a  variety  of  techniques  in  order  to  extract  useful information from source documents like  Parts of  Speech (POS) tagging,  Chunking or Shadow Parsing, Stop-words (Keywords that are used and must be removed before processing documents), Stemming (Mapping words to some base for,  it has  two methods,  dictionary based  stemming and  Porter style stemming (Porter, 1980)
