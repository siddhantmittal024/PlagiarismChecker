Natural  Language  Processing  (NLP)  is  a  tract  of  Artificial  Intelligence  and  Linguistics, devoted to make computers understand the statements or words written in human languages. Natural language processing came into existence to ease the userâ€™s work and to satisfy the wish to communicate with the computer in natural language. Since all the users may not be well-versed in machine specific language, NLP caters those users who do not have enough time to learn new languages or get perfection in it.  A language can be defined as a set of rules or set of symbol. Symbol are combined and used for conveying information or broadcasting the information. Symbols are  tyrannized by the Rules. Natural Language Processing  basically can be classified  into two  parts  i.e. Natural Language  Understanding  and  Natural  Language  Generation  which  evolves  the task  to understand and generate the text .
