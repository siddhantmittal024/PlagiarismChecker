Natural  Language Generation  (NLG)  is  the  process  of  producing  phrases, sentences  and paragraphs  that are  meaningful  from  an  internal  representation.  It  is  a  part  of  Natural Language Processing  and happens  in four phases:  identifying the  goals, planning on  how goals maybe achieved by evaluating the situation and available communicative sources and realizing the plans as a text. It is opposite to Understanding. Natural Language  Processing can  be applied  into various areas  like Machine Translation, Email Spam detection, Information Extraction, Summarization, Question Answering etc.As most of the world is online, the task of making data accessible and available to all is a challenge.  Major  challenge in  making  data  accessible  is  the language  barrier.  There  are multitude of languages with different sentence structure and grammar. Machine Translation is generally  translating phrases  from  one  language to  another  with  the help  of  a statistical engine like  Google Translate.  The challenge  with machine  translation technologies is  not directly translating words but keeping the meaning of sentences intact along with grammar and tenses.
