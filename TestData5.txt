Most of the work in Natural Language Processing is conducted by computer scientists while various other  professionals have  also shown  interest such  as linguistics,  psychologist  and philosophers etc. One of the most ironical aspect of NLP is that it adds up to the knowledge of  human  language.  The  field  of  Natural  Language  Processing  is  related  with  different theories and techniques that  deal with  the problem  of natural  language of  communicating with the computers. Ambiguity  is  one of  the major  problem of  natural language  which is usually  faced in  syntactic  level which  has  subtask  as  lexical  and  morphology  which  are concerned with the study of words and  word  formation. Each of these levels  can produce ambiguities that can be solved by the knowledge of the complete sentence. The ambiguity can be solved  by various  methods such  as Minimising Ambiguity,  Preserving Ambiguity, Interactive Disambiguity and Weighting Ambiguity.
